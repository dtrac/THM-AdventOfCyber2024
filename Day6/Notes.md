## General

## YARA

(Yet Another Recursive Acronym) rules are a tool widely used for identifying and classifying malware based on textual or binary patterns. They are highly customizable and allow security researchers to create patterns (rules) that match specific attributes or characteristics of files, network traffic, or memory processes.

A YARA rule consists of:

- Metadata: Descriptive information about the rule.
- Strings: Text or binary patterns to look for.
- Conditions: Logical expressions that define when the rule should trigger.

## Example YARA Rule:

```yara
rule ExampleMalware
{
    meta:
        description = "Detects Example Malware"
        author = "Your Name"
        date = "2024-01-01"
    strings:
        $text1 = "malicious_code_signature"
        $text2 = "AnotherPattern"
        $binary1 = { 4D 5A 90 00 }
    condition:
        any of ($text1, $text2) or $binary1
}
```
