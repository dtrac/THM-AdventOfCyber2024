## Key Terms

- Governance is the function that creates the framework that an organisation uses to make decisions regarding information security. Governance is the creation of an organisation's security strategy, policies, standards, and practices in alignment with the organisation's overall goal. Governance also defines the roles and responsibilities that everyone in the organisation has to play to help ensure these security standards are met.

- Risk is the function that helps to identify, assess, quantify, and mitigate risk to the organisation's IT assets. Risk helps the organisation understand potential threats and vulnerabilities and the impact that they could have if a threat actor were to execute or exploit them. By simply turning on a computer, an organisation has some level of risk of a cyber attack. The risk function is important to help reduce the overall risk to an acceptable level and develop contingency plans in the event of a cyber attack where a risk is realised.

- Compliance is the function that ensures that the organisation adheres to all external legal, regulatory, and industry standards. For example, adhering to the GDPR law or aligning the organisation's security to an industry standard such as NIST or ISO 27001.

## Example Risk Liklihood Assignment

- Improbable: So unlikely that it might never happen.
- Remote: Very unlikely to happen, but still, there is a possibility.
- Occasional: Likely to happen once/sometime.
- Probable: Likely to happen several times.
- Frequent: Likely to happen often and regularly.

## Example Assigning Impact

- Informational: Very low impact, almost non-existent.
- Low: Impacting a limited part of one area of the organisation's operations, with little to no revenue loss.
- Medium: Impacting one part of the organisation's operations completely, with major revenue loss.
- High: Impacting several parts of the organisation's operations, causing significant revenue loss
- Critical: Posing an existential threat to the organisation.
